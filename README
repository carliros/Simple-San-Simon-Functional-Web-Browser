Simple San Simon Functional Web Browser
=======================================

It is a computer desktop program for rendering web pages.
One nice thing is that it is written with Haskell, a purely funcional programming language.
It supports a generic markup language (like ~ html or xhtml or xml) and part of CSS.

In order to test it, you have to install and then configure.

First way of installation
-------------------------

Installation:
    Basically, you can install it in the way you have known.
    For example, using cabal:
        cabal install 3sfwbrowser
    or manually:
        runhaskell Setup.hs configure
        runhaskell Setup.hs build
        runhaskell Setup.hs install

Configuration:
    After you install the browser, you have to configure it.
    In order to get it configured, you have to
        First, copy the "config" directory to the place where the binary is.
               For example, if the binary generated is on /usr/local/bin/
               , you have to copy the "config" directory to /usr/local/bin/
        Second, copy the "tmp" directory to the place where the binary is.
                For example, if the binary generated is on /usr/local/bin/
                , you have to copy the "tmp" directory to /usr/local/bin/

Why to copy those thow directories?
The first one ('config') saves the config files for the browser, for example 
the default stylesheet for the browser is 'html4.css', there is also
a config file to remmember stylesheet's files, it is 'dbf'
The 'tmp' directory is the place where all resources from the web are downloaded.

Second way of instalation
-------------------------

    The second is using the 'Makefile', which compile all application.
    But you have to consider that it just will build the application, it wont install.

    To build the application, just type:  make
    Then, in order to excute, type: ./3sfwbrowser

Note.- In both ways you have to install all dependencies, but you can use the cabal file
to know what dependencies you need, and then use the Makefile to build the application.
