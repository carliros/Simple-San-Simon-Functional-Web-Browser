Simple San Simon Functional Web Browser
=======================================

It is a computer desktop program for rendering web pages.
One nice thing is that it is written with Haskell, a purely funcional programming language.
It supports a generic markup language (like ~ html or xhtml or xml) and part of CSS.

To install
----------

cabal install

or you can use the Makefile to build the executable.

We have a configuration directory ('config' directory) that should be placed
at your home directory: '~/.3SFWebBrowser/'.  If you are using Cabal, it will
be created automatically, but if you are using 'make' you will have to copy 
manually the 'config' content directory to the config path at your home.

You will also need to edit '~/.3SFWebBrowser/dbf' and setup the proper path for
'User_Agent_Stylesheet' which is located at the same directory.
