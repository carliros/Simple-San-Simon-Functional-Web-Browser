        <h1>Conclusion de XMonad:</h1>

        <p>
           By moving more information into our pure data structure, we are 
           able to make stronger statements about the behaviour of our code, 
           on that information. 
           <span>By using a purely functional data structure, and QuickCheck, 
           we can encode these statements as QuickCheck properties, and have 
           them tested automatically.</span>
           Finally, by using a data structure which more closely models the 
           domain we are looking at, the implementation becomes simpler, 
           cleaner and more obviously correct, and with a strong, statically 
           typed data structure, we get behaviour for free that previously 
           required dynamic checking. 
           The data type described here is the core of a branch of the 
           xmonad window manager.

           The zipper version of xmonad is running on my laptop as I write, 
           and plans are to merge it into the main xmonad branch soon. 
           Perhaps the most interesting result is that xmonad is now 50 lines 
           shorter. By moving more logic (explicit focus handling) into the 
           pure StackSet data structure, most of the event handling code 
           is now just a shallow wrapper over the StackSet api. Smarter 
           data structures, less code. It is all good.
        </p>

           Thanks goes to Wouter Swiestra for the original idea of using a 
           zipper to implement focus-tracking in the xmonad, and to 
           Spencer Janssen, Jason Creighton and David Roundy for several 
           discussions about the subtleties of focus behaviour.
