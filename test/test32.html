        <p style="white-space: nowrap">This paragraph is not allowed to wrap,
            wich means that the only way to end a line is to insert a line-break 
            element. If no such element is inserted, then the line will go forever,
            forcing the user agent to scroll horizontally to read whatever can't be 
            initially displayed <br /> in the browser window</p>
